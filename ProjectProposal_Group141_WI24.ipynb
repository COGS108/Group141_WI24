    "# **Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project's hypothesis is the following: \"It is possible to predict the onset of Alzheimers based on the combination of (1) clinical data* and (2) personal features such as gender, age, years of education, and socioeconomic status.\" We believe that we will be able to successfully train a model that is able to predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease because, as mentioned in the background portion of the proposal, there has been numerous successful machine learning models trained on clinical data to predict the onset of a disease. The clinical data provide variables that capture both the cognitive and structural changes associated with the disease's progression. Incorporating personal features such as gender and age in the prediction model is justified by extensive research indicating that these factors can influence the risk and progression rate of Alzheimer's disease. Together, we believe that this will be enough data to train a model to predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Clinical data include Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), visit number, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), Normalize Whole Brain Volume (nWBV), and the Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF)\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ideal dataset to train our machine learning model would contain clinical and personal variables that capture the progression and risk level of Alzheimer's disease. These datasets would have to be found online from reputable medical research centers or through large-scale longitudinal studies focusing on aging and dementia. Within these studies, MRI scans and protocols should be conducted using standardized procedures for consistency across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "     In addition, a large sample size would be ideal, although preliminary searches in clinical data seem to range around 500 for diseases. We also note that although incorporating many variables will make it difficult to interpret and determine what the main driving factor is in which makes the model predict the onset of the disease in an individual, our goal is just to create a model that is able to predict the onset given a set of clinical and personal variables that are commonly available. Perhaps determining which factor influences the model's decision the most may be another interesting avenue to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The clinical variables in which we want to examine are the following:\n",
    "     - Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE): A measure of cognitive impairment.\n",
    "     - Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR): A numerical scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia.\n",
    "     - Estimated Total Intracranial Volume (eTIV)\n",
    "     - Normalize Whole Brain Volume (nWBV)   \n",
    "     - Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF): Measures of brain volume and structure, obtained from MRI scans, that can indicate brain atrophy associated with Alzheimer's.\n",
    "     - Visit Number\n",
    "\n",
    "     Personal features that are commonly associated with Alzhiemer's risk that we also want to include in our project are the following:\n",
    "     - Gender\n",
    "     - Age\n",
    "     - Years of Education\n",
    "     - Socioeconomic Status\n",
    "     - Indicators of cognitive reserve\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Searching for potential datasets, we found that there is the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) which makes available MRI data sets related to Alzheimer's disease. We were able to download the dataset and found that it included clinical and personal variables that we ideally wanted to incorporate. OASIS makes available these data to be accessible through csv files which we can download and utilize independently. There is also the UK Biobank which is a large scale database with 500,000 participants which include patient information and brain imaging data, but does not have all indicators. Lastly, we found data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) which collects and stores data from Alzheimer's research centers around the US. The data appears reliable but is not in a standardized format (which requires cleaning as a result).\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  The potential datasets considered, such as OASIS MRI, UK Biobank,\n",
    "     and NACC, may have biases and privacy considerations. For\n",
    "     instance, the OASIS MRI project's terms of use and participant\n",
    "     selection could introduce biases. UK Biobank, despite its size,\n",
    "     might not include a diverse representation of certain populations,\n",
    "     leading to potential biases in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Biases in Dataset Composition and Collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Biases may arise in dataset composition and collection, affecting\n",
    "     the equitable analysis of Alzheimer's prediction. For example, if\n",
    "     the data predominantly includes participants from specific\n",
    "     demographic groups, it could introduce biases in the model.\n",
    "     Additionally, variations in data collection methods across\n",
    "     different research centers, as in the case of NACC, may impact\n",
    "     standardization, potentially leading to biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection and Mitigation of Biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  To detect biases, the group will conduct a thorough review of the\n",

    "     recruitment methods. During data preprocessing, the team will\n",
    "     analyze variables for potential biases, ensuring a balanced\n",

    "\n",
    "Other Issues Related to Privacy and Equitable Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Privacy concerns arise from the sensitive nature of medical data,\n",
    "     especially in Alzheimer's research. Ensuring participant anonymity\n",
    "     and adhering to privacy regulations are paramount. Equitable\n",
    "     impact considerations involve understanding if the model's\n",
    "     predictions could disproportionately affect certain groups. It is\n",
    "     essential to communicate findings responsibly, avoiding\n",
    "     reinforcing existing biases or stigmatizing specific populations.\n",
