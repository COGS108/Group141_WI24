    "Our project's hypothesis is the following: \"It is possible to predict the onset of Alzheimers based on the combination of (1) clinical data* and (2) personal features such as gender, age, years of education, and socioeconomic status.\" We believe that we will be able to successfully train a model that is able to predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease because, as mentioned in the background portion of the proposal, there has been numerous successful machine learning models trained on clinical data to predict the onset of a disease. The clinical data provide variables that capture both the cognitive and structural changes associated with the disease's progression. Incorporating personal features such as gender and age in the prediction model is justified by extensive research indicating that these factors can influence the risk and progression rate of Alzheimer's disease. Together, we believe that this will be enough data to train a model to predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset provided by The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) contains a collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on 2 or more visits, separated by one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. All subjects were right-handed and included both men and women. 72 subjects were charaterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 subjects subjects were characterized as demented at their initial vists and remained so for subsequent scans. Lastly, 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at their initial vist but were subsequently characterized as demented in later visits. Important variables are years of education (EDUC), socioeconomic status (SES; 1 to 5), mini mental state examination (MMSE score), clinical dementia rating (CDR rating scale), estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), normalize whole brain volume(nWBV), and atlas scaling factor (ASF). \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables may be proxies for Alzheimers/cognitive state (conjecture):\n",
    "- __EDUC__: Represents years of education which may proxy for cognitive reserve. Higher education levels may result in better cognitive function and reduced risk of dementia. \n",
    "- __SES__: Ranging from 1 to 5, is a proxy for income, education level, and occupation, which represents environmental influences on cognitive health. \n",
    "- __MMSE__: A widely used screening tool for cognitive impairment. Scores range from 1 to 30 with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The examination assesses domains such as orientation, memory, attention, and language. \n",
    "- __CDR__: CDR scale is also commonly used to assess severity of dementia symptoms. The scale ranges from 0 to 3 where 0 indicates no dementia, 0.5 is questionable dementia, 1 is mild dementia, 2 is moderate dementia, and 3 is severe dementia.\n",
    "- __eTIV__: Indicates the total volume inside the skull (including brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.). It is measured in cubic centimeters (cc) and can help establish baseline brain size. Decrease/varying sizes may proxy for cognitive function and Alzheimer's risk.\n",
    "- __nWBV__: Represents the volume of the brain normalized to the subject's eTIV. It is expressed as a percentage, reflecting the proportion of the brain occupying the eTIV (nWBV = brain volume / eTIV). Changes in nWBV may be indicative of brain atrophy which is a common feature of Alzheimer's and dementia.\n",
    "- __ASF__: A scaling factor used in brain imaging to adjust for individual differences in brain size and shape. It accounts for variability in brain morphology allowing for accurate comparisons of brain structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided by OASIS is relatively clean and organized. However, some cleaning may be required, such as changing M/F and group to numeric values, dropping columns such as MRI ID, Visit, and Hand which will not be used in our predictions. All of this will be done by manipulating the dataframe. "
